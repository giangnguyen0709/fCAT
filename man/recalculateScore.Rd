\title{The output of fdogFAS is a phylogenetic profile (pp). But this pp still can
not be used to assess the completeneness of the interested genome. The pp
will contains the ortholog sequence within the training sequence. The FAS
score of each sequence is the FAS score between itself and the core group's
ortholog sequence. Therefore the score must be recalculated, for score mode
2 and 3 the score between the ortholog sequence and the score of the training
sequence must be swaped. For score mode 1 the avarage score of the training 
sequences must be calculated and updated into the line of the ortholog
sequence. This function will be used as a modul in concanateFiles. The 
function will remove all the line of the training sequences and return the pp
of the interested genome.}

\item{pp}{The phylogenetic profile output from fdogFAS in form of a
